# Add tags to the posts

We need tags to organize the posts, so we can show in our frontend
only posts that are related to a specific tag

To make it easier for the user, the tags should be set automatically
if they appear the posts title or content.
Afterwards the user should be able to change the automatically assigned 
tags manually.

We currently want the following tags:
  - python
  - vue
  - nodejs
  - php
