# Add tags to the posts

We need tags to organize the posts, so we can show in our frontend
only posts that are related to a specific tag. To save network bandwidth
add the option to only receive posts for a specific tag.

Also to make it easier for the authors when they create a post, the tags
should be set automatically if they appear the posts title or content.
Afterwards the user should be able to manually change the assigned tags
in case there was something wrong.

We currently want support for the following tags:
  - python
  - vue
  - nodejs
  - php
